Task:2 - Data Visualization & Storytelling

Objective
The goal of this task was to practice creating clear, engaging, and meaningful visualizations from sales data, using Power BI or Tableau. 
The focus was on telling a story with the data — not just making charts, but communicating insights that support business decisions.

 Tools Used

Power BI** *(used for this task)*
Dataset Used: Superstore.csv

  Step-by-Step Process

 1. Load the Dataset
 Imported `Superstore.csv` into Power BI.

 2. Explore the Data
 Reviewed columns like Sales, Profit, Region, Category, and Order Date.
 Checked for missing values or formatting issues.

 3. Clean and Prepare Data
Converted Order Date to proper date format.
Removed unnecessary columns (if any).
Filtered out incomplete rows.

 4. Create Visualizations
Built the following charts:

Sales by Region (Map or Bar Chart)  
 Showed sales distribution across different regions.

Monthly Profit Trend (Line Chart)  
  Displayed how profit changed over time.

 Sales and Profit by Category (Stacked Bar Chart)  
  Compared performance of different product categories.

Top 10 Sub-Categories by Sales (Bar Chart) 
  Ranked best-selling sub-categories.

Profit by Discount Range (Scatter Plot)  
  Showed how discounts affect profitability.

 5. Design the Dashboard
 Arranged all charts into a single dashboard.
 Used consistent colors and fonts.
 Added titles, data labels, and a summary box.
 Focused on simplicity and easy interpretation.

Key Insights

The West region had strong sales but moderate profit.
Technology category was most profitable overall.
Tables had high sales but negative profit.
Most profitable months were November and December (possible seasonal sales).
 Giving high discounts often led to low or negative profit.



 What I Learned

 How to choose the right visualization for different types of data.
 How to clean and organize data for reporting.
 How to tell a story through dashboards — by showing trends, comparisons, and highlights.
 Best practices for using Power BI like filters, slicers, and drill-downs.


Interview Questions & My Answers

 1. What is the importance of data visualization?
Data visualization helps us understand data faster by turning raw numbers into graphs and charts. It makes it easier to find trends, patterns, and outliers.

 2. When do you use a pie chart vs a bar chart?
Pie charts are for showing proportions (like market share), best used with fewer categories. Bar charts are better for comparing values across multiple items.

 3. How do you make visualizations more engaging?
Use clear labels, avoid clutter, highlight important values, and keep the design clean. Tell a story with the visuals instead of just showing numbers.

 4. What is data storytelling?
Data storytelling is using visuals + insights to guide the audience through a narrative. It explains what is happening in the data, why it's important, and what to do next.

5. How do you avoid misleading visualizations?
Don’t distort axes, don’t hide data, avoid cherry-picking, and always give context (like timeframes, units, totals).

 6. What are best practices in dashboard design?
- Keep it simple and focused
- Group related charts
- Use consistent colors
- Highlight key metrics
- Avoid too many visuals on one screen

 7. What tools have you used for visualization?
 I used Power BI for this task. I’m also familiar with Tableau and Excel charts.
